//! Integration tests for VRF with AVNU Paymaster.
//!
//! These tests verify VRF functionality with both sponsored and self-funded transactions.
//! The VRF proof is generated and bundled with the transaction calls.
//!
//! ## How VRF Works (Nested Outside Execution)
//!
//! The VRF flow requires nested outside execution:
//!
//! 1. **Outer execution** (VRF Account signs):
//!    - `submit_random(seed, proof)` - inject VRF proof
//!    - `execute_from_outside_v2(inner_execution)` - call player's account
//!
//! 2. **Inner execution** (Player Account signs):
//!    - `request_random(caller, source)` - signal VRF intent
//!    - `dice()` - the actual game call that consumes random
//!
//! The seed is computed using the player's address (who calls request_random).
//!
//! ## Test Structure
//!
//! - `test_vrf_sponsored_execute`: VRF with paymaster-sponsored gas fees
//! - `test_vrf_self_funded_execute`: VRF with user-paid gas fees
